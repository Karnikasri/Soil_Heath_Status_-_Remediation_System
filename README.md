# Soil Health Prediction & Microbial Recommendation
## Overview
This project builds a hybrid system combining rule-based logic and machine learning to classify soil health status (Poor, Moderate, Good) using real agricultural datasets augmented with synthetic data. Additionally, it recommends beneficial microbial treatments tailored to soil nutrient deficiencies to improve soil fertility and crop yield.

## Features
Soil health classification using government-defined nutrient thresholds and ML models trained with augmented data.
Microbial recommendation engine suggesting bacteria like Azospirillum and Pseudomonas fluorescens for soil remediation.
Automated data preprocessing including cleaning, balancing, and threshold-based labeling to ensure consistent and reliable modeling inputs.
Accessibility enhancements: OCR extraction of soil health cards, multilingual interface, and dosage/cost estimation for practical farming application.

## Technologies
Python, Pandas, NumPy for data processing
Scikit-learn for machine learning (Random Forest classifier)
OCR tools for automated data extraction (optional integration)

## Usage
Preprocess raw soil data using the automated scripts provided.
Train or load the pre-trained ML model for soil health classification.

# Input soil nutrient values to receive health status and microbial dosage recommendations.

# Utilize dosage and cost estimation tools for field application planning.
